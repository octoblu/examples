# Robeaux

Robeaux (/rō-bō/) is a universal dashboard to your robotic devices. Like a router admin
page, but for robots.

Robeaux is powered by [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and provides
a front-end to the API interface offered by [Artoo](http://artoo.io),
[Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com) and [Gobot](http://gobot.io). It looks like this:

## How It Works

Thanks to using a structured interface based on the RESTful and websockets APIs
of Artoo, Cylon.js and Gobot, Robeaux can query or set values on one or more
robots, and all of the devices connected to each robot. As long as they are
connected to a compatible API server.

### Robots

You can see each robot that your are connected to, and then drill in to view or
edit it.

### Connections

How are you connected? Serial port? WiFi? View the details for each of your
robots.

### Devices

Each robot has one or more devices connected. You can view the device status and
send commands all via the web interface. You can even stream the real-time
websockets data for your buttons, switches, LEDs, sensors, and more.
