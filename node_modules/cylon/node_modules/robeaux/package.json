  "readme": "# Robeaux\n\nRobeaux (/rō-bō/) is a universal dashboard to your robotic devices. Like a router admin\npage, but for robots.\n\nRobeaux is powered by [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and provides\na front-end to the API interface offered by [Artoo](http://artoo.io),\n[Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com) and [Gobot](http://gobot.io). It looks like this:\n\n![Robeaux Interface](http://i.imgur.com/rDf5inl.png)\n\n## How It Works\n\nThanks to using a structured interface based on the RESTful and websockets APIs\nof Artoo, Cylon.js and Gobot, Robeaux can query or set values on one or more\nrobots, and all of the devices connected to each robot. As long as they are\nconnected to a compatible API server.\n\n### Robots\n\nYou can see each robot that your are connected to, and then drill in to view or\nedit it.\n\n![Robots View](http://i.imgur.com/4388Mce.png)\n\n### Connections\n\nHow are you connected? Serial port? WiFi? View the details for each of your\nrobots.\n\n![Connections View](http://i.imgur.com/ewJ9Ec2.png)\n\n### Devices\n\nEach robot has one or more devices connected. You can view the device status and\nsend commands all via the web interface. You can even stream the real-time\nwebsockets data for your buttons, switches, LEDs, sensors, and more.\n\n![Devices View](http://i.imgur.com/aB5YL7Q.png)\n\n## Pushing new versions\n\nBefore you push a new release, make sure to create a tag:\n\n    git tag -m \"[VERSION]\" [VERSION]\n\nAnd push it to GitHub\n\n    git push --tags\n\n### RubyGems:\n\n    gem build robeaux.gemspec\n    gem push robeaux-[VERSION].gem\n\n### NPM\n\n    npm publish ./\n\n## LICENSE\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 The Hybrid Group\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\nthis file except in compliance with the License.
