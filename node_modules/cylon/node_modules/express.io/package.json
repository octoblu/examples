Express.io is designed to be a superset of Express and Socket.io.  An easy to use drop-in replacement that makes it simple to get started with the realtime-web.\n\n## Realtime Routing is Sweet\n\nWith express.io you can do realtime routing like a pro.\n\n```js\napp.io.route('customers', {\n    create: function(req) {\n        // create your customer\n    },\n    update: function(req) {\n        // update your customer\n    },\n    remove: function(req) {\n        // remove your customer\n    },\n});\n```\n\nAnd then on the client you would emit these events:\n\n* `customers:create`\n* `customers:update`\n* `customers:delete`\n\nOr do it the old fashioned way:\n\n```js\napp.io.route('my-realtime-route', function(req) {\n    // respond to the event\n});\n```\n\n## Automatic Session Support\n\nSessions work automatically, just set them up like normal using express.\n\n```js\napp.use(express.session({secret: 'express.io makes me happy'}));\n```\n\n## Double Up - Forward Normal Http Routes to Realtime Routes\n\nIt's easy to forward regular http routes to your realtime routes.\n\n```js\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n    req.io.route('some-cool-realtime-route');\n});\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n__All of these examples work.__  I repeat, __they all work__.  Express.io is a very simple framework that allows you to build incredibly complex realtime apps with very little code.\n\n[All Examples](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#readme)\n\nOr view them bite size:\n\n* [Simple HTTP + IO Setup](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#simple-http--io-setup)\n* [Simple HTTPS + IO Setup](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#simple-https--io-setup)\n* [Routing](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#routing)\n* [Route Forwarding](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#route-forwarding)\n* [Broadcasting](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#broadcasting)\n* [Sessions](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#sessions)\n* [Rooms](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#rooms)\n* [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#acknowledgements)\n* [Realtime Canvas](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#realtime-canvas)\n* [Scaling with Redis](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#scaling-with-redis)\n\nTo run the examples from git, do the following:\n\n```js\ngit clone https://github.com/techpines/express.io\ncd express.io/examples\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen you'll be ready to run the example code with a simple:\n\n```\nnode app.js\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis should help you get a birds eye view of the __express.io__ architecture.  Simple and lean.  Reuse your express and socket.io knowledge.\n\n[API Reference](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#readme)\n\nHere are all the wonderful __express.io__ objects!\n\n* [ExpressIO](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#expressio)\n* [ExpressApp](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#expressapp)\n* [AppIO](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#appio)\n* [SocketRequest](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#socketrequest)\n* [RequestIO](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/lib#requestio)\n\n## FAQ\n\nHave frequent questions, we have frequent answers.\n\n[Check here](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/docs/faq.md).\n\n## Test\n\nWe have a full test suite.  We also run the full express test suite to ensure compatibility.\n\n```bash\ncd express.io\nnpm test\n```\n\n\n\n## License\nIt's free!
