Cylon.js is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js.

It provides a simple, yet powerful way to create solutions that incorporate multiple, different hardware devices at the same time.

## Examples:

### Basic

#### Arduino with an LED, using the Firmata protocol.

The example below connects to an Arduino, and every second turns the LED either on, or off. 

The example requires that the Arduino has the Firmata sketch installed, and that it is connected on the port `/dev/ttyACM0`. You need to install Firmata on your Arduino, and to change the `port` parameter to match the port that your system is actually using.

Make sure to upload the "Standard Firmata" sketch or an equivalent Firmata sketch to your Arduino first. Without that code running on the Arduino, Firmata can't communicate with Cylon. You can find the example sketch in your Arduino software under "Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata".

##### JavaScript:

```javascript
var Cylon = require("cylon");

// Initialize the robot
var robot = Cylon.robot({
  // Change the port to the correct port for your Arduino.
  connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
  device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13 },

  work: function(my) {
    // we do our thing here
    every((1).second(), function() { my.led.toggle(); });
  }
});

// start working
robot.start();
```

##### CoffeeScript:

```javascript
Cylon = require "cylon"

# Initialize the robot
robot = Cylon.robot
  connection:
    name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

  device:
    name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13

  work: (my) ->
    # we do our thing here
    every 1.second(), -> my.led.toggle()

robot.start()
```
#### Parrot ARDrone 2.0

##### JavaScript:

```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1' },
  device: { name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone' },

  work: function(my) {
    my.drone.takeoff();
    after(10..seconds(), function() { my.drone.land(); });
    after(15..seconds(), function() { my.drone.stop(); });
  }
}).start();
```
##### CoffeeScript:

```javascript
Cylon = require 'cylon'

Cylon.robot
  connection: { name: 'ardrone', adaptor: 'ardrone', port: '192.168.1.1' }
  device: { name: 'drone', driver: 'ardrone' }

  work: (my) ->
    my.drone.takeoff()
    after 10.seconds(), -> my.drone.land()
    after 15.seconds(), -> my.drone.stop()

.start()
```

**Note:** before running any examples in the `examples/` dir from source, make sure to compile using `grunt coffee` first.

## Getting Started

### Installation

All you need to get started is the `cylon` module:

    npm install cylon

Then install modules for whatever hardware support you want to use from your robot. For the example below, an Arduino using the Firmata protocol:

    npm install cylon-firmata

## CLI

Cylon has a Command Line Interface (CLI) so you can access important features
right from the command line.

    Usage: cylon [command] [options]

    Commands:

      generate <name>        Generates a new adaptor

    Options:

      -h, --help     output usage information
      -V, --version  output the version number

### Generator

Want to integrate a hardware device we don't have Cylon support for yet? There's
a generator for that!

You can easily generate a new skeleton Cylon adaptor to
help you get started. Simply run the `cylon generate` command, and the
generator will create a new directory with all of the files in place for your
new adaptor module.

    $ cylon generate awesome_device
    Creating cylon-awesome_device adaptor.
    Compiling templates.

    $ ls ./cylon-awesome_device
