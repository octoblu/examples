# Cylon.js For Firmata

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides an adaptor for microcontrollers such as Arduino that support the Firmata protocol (http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page). It uses the Firmata node module (https://github.com/jgautier/firmata) created by [@jgautier](https://github.com/jgautier) thank you!

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-firmata.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-firmata)

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install cylon-firmata`

## Examples

### JavaScript:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
  devices: [{name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
            {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}],

  work: function(my) {
    my.button.on('push', function() {my.led.toggle()});
  }
}).start();
```

### CoffeeScript:
```
Cylon = require('cylon')

# Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot
  connection:
    name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

  devices:
    [
      {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
      {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}
    ]

  work: (my) ->
    my.button.on 'push', -> my.led.toggle()

.start()
```
## Connecting to Arduino

### OSX

The main steps are:
- Install the cylon-firmata npm module
- Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
- Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
- Connect to the device using Cylon

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port. A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected. Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

Install the cylon-firmata module:

```
$ npm install cylon-firmata
```

Once plugged in, use the `cylon scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

```
$ cylon scan serial
```

Use the `cylon firmata install` command to install avrdude,
this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

```
$ cylon firmata install
```

Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran
`cylon scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `/dev/ttyACM0`:

```
$ cylon firmata upload /dev/ttyACM0
```

Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection

### Ubuntu

The main steps are:
- Install the cylon-firmata npm module
- Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
- Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
- Connect to the device using Cylon

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.

Install the cylon-firmata module:

```
$ npm install cylon-firmata
```

Once plugged in, use the `cylon scan serial` command to find out your connection info and serial port address:

```
$ cylon scan serial
```

Use the `cylon firmata install` command to install avrdude,
this will allow you to upload firmata to the arduino:

```
$ cylon firmata install
```

Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran
`cylon scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `ttyACM0`:

```
$ cylon firmata upload ttyACM0
```

Now you are ready to connect and communicate with the Arduino using serial port connection

### Windows

We are currently working on docs and instructions for Windows. Please check back soon!

* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.
* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.
* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.
* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* All pull requests should be "fast forward"
  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”
  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”
  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git
