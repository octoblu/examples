# Cylon.js For GPIO

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides drivers for General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) devices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output). It is normally not used directly, but instead is registered by adaptor modules such as cylon-firmata (https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-firmata) that support the needed interfaces for GPIO devices.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-gpio.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-gpio)

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install cylon-gpio`

## Examples

### JavaScript:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
  devices: [{name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
            {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}],

  work: function(my) {
    my.button.on('push', function() {my.led.toggle()});
  }
}).start();
```

### CoffeeScript:
```
Cylon = require('cylon')

# Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot
  connection:
    name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

  devices:
    [
      {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13},
      {name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2}
    ]

  work: (my) ->
    my.button.on 'push', -> my.led.toggle()

.start()
```
## Hardware Support
Cylon.js has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following GPIO devices are currently supported:

  - Analog Sensor
  - Button
  - Continuous Servo
  - LED
  - Motor
  - Makey Button (high-resistance button like the [MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/))
  - Maxbotix Ultrasonic Range Finder
  - Servo

More drivers are coming soon...

* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.
* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.
* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.
* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* All pull requests should be "fast forward"
  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”
  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”
  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git
