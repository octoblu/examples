# Cylon.js For i2c

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides drivers for i2c devices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). You would not normally use this module directly, instead it is used by Cylon.js adaptors that have i2c support.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hybridgroup/cylon-i2c)

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install cylon-i2c`

## Examples

### Javascript:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
  device: {name: 'blinkm', driver: 'blinkm'},

  work: function(my) {
    var lit = false;
    my.blinkm.on('start', function() {
      my.blinkm.off()
      every((1).seconds(), function() {
        if (lit === true) {
          lit = false;
          my.blinkm.rgb(0xaa, 0, 0);
        } else {
          lit = true;
          my.blinkm.rgb(0, 0, 0);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}).start();
```

### CoffeeScript:
```
Cylon = require('cylon')

Cylon.robot
  connection:
    name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0'

  device:
    name: 'blinkm', driver: 'blinkm'

  work: (my) ->
    lit = false

    my.blinkm.on 'start', ->
      my.blinkm.off()

      every 1.second(), ->
        if lit
          lit = false
          my.blinkm.rgb 0xaa, 0, 0
        else
          lit = true
          my.blinkm.rgb 0, 0, 0      

.start()
```

## Hardware Support
Cylon.js has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following i2c devices are currently supported:

  - BlinkM
  - HMC6352 Digital Compass
  - LCD
  - MPL115A2 Digital Barometer & Thermometer
  
More drivers are coming soon...
